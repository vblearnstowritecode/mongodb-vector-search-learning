# MongoDB Vector Search Learning Scratchpad

This is a rough scratch pad repository created while learning MongoDB and vector search concepts.

## Purpose

A hands-on learning space to experiment with:
- MongoDB Atlas vector search
- Text embeddings with OpenAI
- Pydantic data validation
- Vector similarity searches
- Building recommendation systems

## Inspiration

Inspired by the course: [Prompt Compression and Query Optimization](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/prompt-compression-and-query-optimization/)

## What's Inside

- `vector_search_complete_ordered.ipynb` - Step-by-step tutorial implementing vector search with Airbnb dataset
- Experiments with embeddings, similarity search, and GPT-powered recommendations

## Note

This is a learning repository - code is intentionally simple and exploratory. Not production-ready!
