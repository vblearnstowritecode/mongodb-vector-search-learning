    "1. 🔍 You provide a query (e.g., \"cozy apartment near restaurants\")\n",
    "2. 🔄 Query gets converted to a 1536-dimension vector\n",
    "3. 📐 MongoDB compares your query vector with all stored vectors using cosine similarity\n",
    "4. 📊 Returns the most similar listings ranked by similarity score\n",
    "\n",

    "- Focuses on direction/content rather than magnitude\n",
    "- Perfect for text embeddings where meaning matters more than absolute values\n",
    "- Range: -1 (opposite) to 1 (identical)\n",

    "**Index benefits:**\n",
    "- ⚡ **Speed**: Fast searches through millions of vectors\n",
    "- 🎯 **Accuracy**: Finds semantically similar content\n",
