    "1. Performs vector search + boosting (reusing Lesson 4)\n",
    "2. Compresses verbose search results using LLMLingua-2\n",

    "## Phase 3: Understanding Prompt Compression\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need Compression?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we perform vector search with boosting, we retrieve **20 detailed listings** from MongoDB. Each listing contains:\n",
    "- Name, accommodates, bedrooms\n",
    "- Full address with location\n",
    "- Neighborhood overview (long text descriptions)\n",
    "- Review scores and counts\n",
    "- Combined scores\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:**\n",
    "- 20 listings × ~150 tokens each = **~3,000 tokens**\n",
    "- Sending this to GPT-3.5 costs **$0.0015 per 1K tokens**\n",
    "- For 1 million queries: **$4,500 in token costs!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution:**\n",
    "- Use **LLMLingua-2** to compress results from 3,000 → 500 tokens (6x compression)\n",
    "- Same 1 million queries: **$750 in token costs**\n",
    "- **Savings: $3,750 (83% cost reduction!)**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Gets Compressed?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Component | Compressed? | Why? |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|------|\n",
    "| **System Prompt** | ❌ No | Short and essential (\"You are an Airbnb recommendation system\") |\n",
    "| **User Query** | ❌ No | Must preserve exact user intent |\n",
    "| **Search Results** | ✅ **YES** | Verbose, repetitive, contains filler words |\n",
    "| **GPT Answer** | ❌ No | Generated after compression |\n",
    "\n",
    "**What LLMLingua removes from search results:**\n",
    "- Filler words: \"In the neighborhood of...\", \"you can find...\", \"this area is known for...\"\n",
    "- Redundant phrases: Multiple mentions of \"friendly\", \"warm\", \"welcoming\"\n",
    "- Unnecessary adjectives and connecting words\n",
    "\n",
    "**What LLMLingua keeps:**\n",
    "- Property names\n",
    "- Key numbers (accommodates, scores, review counts)\n",
    "- Location info (country, city)\n",
    "- Essential descriptors (restaurants, cafes, river, beach)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does LLMLingua-2 Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenization**: Breaks text into tokens\n",
    "2. **Importance Scoring**: Uses a small BERT model to score each token's importance for answering the query\n",
    "3. **Intelligent Pruning**: Removes low-importance tokens while preserving semantic meaning\n",
    "4. **Reassembly**: Reconstructs compressed text that GPT can still understand\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Advantages:**\n",
    "- **3x-6x faster** than original LLMLingua\n",
    "- **Task-agnostic**: Works for any domain (not just Airbnb)\n",
    "- **Trained by GPT-4**: Distilled knowledge from GPT-4 for optimal compression\n",

In case you just need to leave your luggage there while you around that also can be arrange if I DO NOT have another guest coming up same day.

(great walking distance for all the events), Easily accessible to subway, tram, ferries. The neighbourhood is friendly and diverse. It is only 3 minutes by walk to the Galatasaray Square which is located approximately at the center of the Istiklal Avenue. Istiklal Avenue is located in the historic Beyoğlu (Pera) district, it is an elegant pedestrian street, 1.4 kilometers long, which houses boutiques, music stores, bookstores, art galleries, cinemas, theatres, libraries, cafés, pubs, night clubs with live music, historical patisseries, chocolateries and restaurants.  You should definately walk through the local bazaar on Sunday right beside the apartment. You can find anything you need with cheap prices; fruits, vegetables, nuts, fish, meat, dairy products! Local bazaars will be very helpful to understand the culture of Turkish people as well. There are couple of restaurants close by where yo  From/To Airports: There are several ways to get from the airport to the apartment, but the most convenient manner is to take “HAVATAŞ\" shuttle to Taksim Square departing every 30 minutes from the airport (from both airports- Atatürk and Sabiha Gökçen). As you may be unfamiliar with the area, I am happy to come and pick you up in front of Galatasaray Highschool (on Istiklal Street) which is 10 minutes walk from Taksim Square where you will get off. I can always advise you cheaper public transport options if you ask for. Useful information: You can rent the apartment/room for (a) day(s), week, month or longer periods of time.  There is various supermarkets conveniently situated a block away from the apartment on the way to Istiklal street, also a small kiosk right next to the apartment and a laundry in 100 meters distance.            9.333333               77.0          56.70\n",
