    "## Understanding Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem with Pure Vector Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector search finds **semantically similar** listings based on text content. However:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A listing might match your query perfectly but have **terrible reviews**\n",
    "- A listing might be described beautifully but be **rarely booked** (low trust signal)\n",
    "- Two similar listings might have very different **quality scores**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Query: \"cozy beachfront apartment\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Result 1: Vector similarity = 0.95, Review avg = 6.2/10, Reviews = 2\n",
    "Result 2: Vector similarity = 0.88, Review avg = 9.8/10, Reviews = 157\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pure vector search ranks Result 1 first, but Result 2 is clearly the better choice!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boosting** = Combining vector similarity with business metrics to improve result quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "We:\n",
    "1. Run vector search first (cast a wide net)\n",
    "2. Calculate quality scores from review data\n",
    "3. Combine scores with weighted formula\n",
    "4. Re-sort results by the combined score\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us the **best of both worlds**: semantic relevance + quality signals."

    "## The Boosting Formula\n",

    "- Checkin\n",

    "- Location\n",
    "- Value\n",
    "\n",
    "We average these to get one overall quality score:\n",

    "```\n",
    "averageReviewScore = (accuracy + cleanliness + checkin + communication + location + value) / 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Combine Scores with Weights\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a `combinedScore` that blends:\n",
    "- **90% weight** on review quality (is it good?)\n",
    "- **10% weight** on review count (is it popular/trusted?)\n",

    "```\n",
    "combinedScore = (averageReviewScore × 0.9) + (number_of_reviews × 0.1)\n",
